ButterCommandLineDescription: "Loads and runs unit test assemblies and collects coverage data using VSTS coverage tools.  The environment variable BUTTER_TOOLPATH can be set to a semi-colon separated list of directories that will be searched in order for the tools needed during coverage instrumentation.  These tools are vsinstr.exe, vsperfcmd.exe, sn.exe, crumb.exe, chgmvid.exe, gacutil.exe, ngen.exe and toast.exe.  BUTTER_KEYFILE can be set to the name of the keyfile to use for resigning if the assemblies are fully signed.  If assemblies are partially signed or not strongly named this environment variable does not need to be set.  Butter's command line is intentionally identical to toast.exe."
